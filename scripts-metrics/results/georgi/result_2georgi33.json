  "problem": "The for-loop uses the condition i <= scores.length, which causes an off-by-one error. Array indices in Java go from 0 to length - 1. Using <= will attempt to access scores[scores.length] which is out of bounds, causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.",
  "solution": "Change the loop condition to i < scores.length to ensure valid array indexing and prevent runtime errors. This is a common pitfall in programming, especially with zero-based indexing. Always ensure loop conditions align with the valid range of indices for arrays or collections."
