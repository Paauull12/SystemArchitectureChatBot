  "problem": "The Car class is tightly coupled to the Engine class by directly instantiating it (new Engine()). This rigid dependency limits flexibility, hinders testing (e.g., mocking), and violates the Dependency Inversion Principle. The Car cannot operate with different engine types or without modification to its source code.",
  "solution": "Use dependency injection to decouple the Car from the Engine. Inject the Engine through the constructor or a setter method, possibly using an interface. This promotes flexibility, allows easier testing, and supports future extensibility without altering the Car class's internal logic."
