  "problem": "The Product class in this code acts as a God class by taking on multiple responsibilities: holding data, calculating tax-inclusive pricing, managing stock levels, and determining availability. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and leads to tight coupling between the domain object and various business logic layers.",
  "solution": "Extract responsibilities such as tax calculation (getPriceAfterTax) and stock modification (decreaseStock) into dedicated service classes like PricingService and InventoryManager. This enhances modularity, encourages reuse, and makes the Product class a clean, focused representation of product data only."
