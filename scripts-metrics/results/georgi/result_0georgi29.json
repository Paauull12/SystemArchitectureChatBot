  "problem": "The design introduces an interface Worker and a class SimpleWorker that implements it, but the scenario is overly simple and does not justify the extra abstraction. This leads to unnecessary complexity (overengineering) for a trivial task that could be handled directly without interfaces.",
  "solution": "Simplify the design by removing the interface and using a concrete class directly unless there is a clear need for multiple implementations or extensibility. Overengineering should be avoided to keep the code clean and maintainable"
