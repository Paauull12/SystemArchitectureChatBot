  "problem": "Many classes create their own ConfigManager instances loading the same config file repeatedly, wasting resources and risking inconsistent configurations if different files or versions are used.",
  "solution": "Use a singleton pattern or dependency injection to share one ConfigManager instance across the application. This ensures configuration is loaded once, reduces resource usage, and keeps configuration consistent."
