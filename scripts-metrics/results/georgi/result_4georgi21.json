  "problem": "The main method contains a return statement before any other code, making the subsequent commented-out line unreachable. This is a classic example of dead code—code that will never execute—which clutters the codebase, reduces readability, and can confuse maintainers.",
  "solution": "Remove unreachable code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. In this case, either delete the return statement if code execution is intended, or remove the commented-out print statement to avoid confusion. Ensuring only reachable, purposeful code remains improves clarity and reduces technical debt."
