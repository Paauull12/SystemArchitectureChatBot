  "problem": "The FileReader in Example7 is opened but never explicitly closed, leading to a resource leak. Failing to close file streams can result in file locks, memory pressure, or hitting file descriptor limitsâ€”especially in long-running applications or those that open many files.",
  "solution": "Use a try-with-resources statement to ensure the FileReader is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. This pattern guarantees proper resource management and is the recommended approach in modern Java for working with Closeable or AutoCloseable resources."
