  "problem": "MegaWorkflowManager class depends on 17 services, blending concerns from authentication to loyalty programs, creating an over-coupled and monolithic design thatâ€™s tough to maintain, extend, or test.",
  "solution": "Decompose into focused domain services (e.g., OrderProcessingService, NotificationService, LoyaltyService), and orchestrate with a dedicated coordinator or facade. This reduces coupling, improves readability, and enhances testability."
