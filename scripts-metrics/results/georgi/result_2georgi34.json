  "problem": "The code catches an IOException but silently ignores it without any handling or logging. This practice makes debugging difficult because errors are suppressed, and the program continues without indicating that something went wrong.",
  "solution": "Handle the exception properly by logging the error message or taking corrective actions. At minimum, print the stack trace or a meaningful error message to help identify the problem during execution."
