  "problem": "UltraManager directly depends on 18 different services, mixing concerns across authentication, catalog, inventory, payment, notification, logging, compliance, and messaging, which creates a highly coupled, difficult to maintain, test, or extend class.",
  "solution": "Refactor by splitting into smaller, cohesive services dedicated to specific responsibilities. Use design patterns like Facade or Mediator to coordinate interactions and reduce tight coupling."
