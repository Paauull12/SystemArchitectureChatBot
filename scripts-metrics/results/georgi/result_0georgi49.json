  "problem": "This EnterpriseOrderProcessor class violates the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, and contributes to tight coupling. With 13 dependencies, any change in the ecosystem has a high risk of ripple effects, and testing this class becomes painful.",
  "solution": "Break it into multiple domain-specific services like OrderWorkflowService, ComplianceHandler, AnalyticsReporter, etc. Use interfaces, dependency inversion, and possibly the Facade or Mediator pattern to decouple the logic and reduce import dependencies."
