  "problem": "The loop repeatedly concatenates strings using the + operator inside a loop, which creates a new String object on each iteration due to the immutability of String in Java. This results in excessive memory allocation and poor performance, especially for large iteration counts, leading to inefficient code and potential performance bottlenecks.",
  "solution": "Use a StringBuilder (or StringBuffer if thread safety is needed) for efficient string construction in loops. StringBuilder maintains a mutable internal buffer, allowing for fast append operations without repeated object creation. This significantly improves performance in scenarios involving frequent string modifications."
