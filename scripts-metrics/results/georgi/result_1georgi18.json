  "problem": "The methods printUserDetails and printAdminDetails contain duplicated logic for printing name and email information. This redundancy violates the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle and leads to unnecessary code repetition, making maintenance harder and increasing the risk of inconsistencies if formatting or logic changes are needed in multiple places.",
  "solution": "To eliminate duplication, extract the common behavior into a shared abstraction, such as a common interface or superclass (e.g., ContactInfoProvider with getName() and getEmail() methods). Both User and Admin can implement this interface, allowing a single method like printDetails(ContactInfoProvider entity) to handle printing generically. This promotes code reuse, simplifies maintenance, and aligns with clean code practices."
