  "problem": "The GodClass violates the God Object Anti-Pattern by taking on too many responsibilities within a single class â€” reading input, computing, writing output, logging, and notifying users. This leads to poor cohesion, harder maintenance, and decreased code readability.",
  "solution": "Refactor the class by separating concerns into multiple smaller, focused classes or components. Each class should handle a single responsibility, improving modularity and maintainability."
