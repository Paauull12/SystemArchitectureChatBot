  "problem": "The for loop uses the condition i <= numbers.length, which causes it to access numbers[5] on the last iteration. Since valid indices for the array numbers range from 0 to 4, this results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This classic off-by-one error leads to runtime failure and is often difficult to detect in more complex logic.",
  "solution": "Change the loop condition to i < numbers.length to ensure iteration remains within valid bounds. Off-by-one errors can be avoided by carefully considering whether a loop should include or exclude the endpoint, and by leveraging enhanced for loops when direct index access is not required."
