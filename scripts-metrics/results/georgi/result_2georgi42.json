  "problem": "MegaOrchestrator is highly coupled with 19 distinct services, managing diverse responsibilities like authentication, inventory, payment, shipping, notifications, compliance, auditing, and more. This leads to a god class thatâ€™s hard to maintain, test, or extend, violating the Single Responsibility Principle and increasing complexity.",
  "solution": "Break down the MegaOrchestrator into smaller, focused classes or services that handle individual concerns. Use design patterns such as Facade, Mediator, or Service Layer to coordinate interactions. This decouples the system, improves maintainability, testing, and scalability."
