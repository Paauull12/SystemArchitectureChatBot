  "problem": "The method getCity() in UserProfile calls address.getCity() without verifying if address has been initialized. In the main method, UserProfile is instantiated without setting an address, resulting in a NullPointerException at runtime when getCity() is invoked. This kind of unchecked dereferencing makes the code brittle and prone to failure under normal usage scenarios.",
  "solution": "Introduce a null check in getCity() to prevent runtime exceptions and handle missing data gracefully. Depending on the use case, return a default value, throw a controlled exception, or use Optional to signal the absence of a value. Ensuring null-safety improves code robustness and user experience by avoiding unexpected crashes."
