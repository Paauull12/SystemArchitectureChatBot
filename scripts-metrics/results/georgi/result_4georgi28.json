  "problem": "The comments in the code are redundant because they state the obvious and do not add any meaningful explanation beyond what the code already clearly conveys. Such comments clutter the code and reduce readability without providing value.",
  "solution": "Remove unnecessary comments that simply restate the code’s actions. Comments should explain why something is done or provide context, not what is done when it’s already clear from the code itself."
