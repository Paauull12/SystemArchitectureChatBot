  "problem": "Each class that logs creates its own FileLogger with its own file path, leading to multiple log files or inconsistent logging formats. This complicates log management and increases resource usage.",
  "solution": "Centralize logging by making FileLogger a singleton logger service or use an existing logging framework (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) to unify logs. Inject or configure a shared logger instance across the app, ensuring consistent log formatting, file management, and easier monitoring."
