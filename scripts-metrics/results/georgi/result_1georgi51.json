  "problem": "UltraServiceOrchestrator class depends on 15 other services, combining authentication, inventory, payments, notifications, logging, reporting, analytics, compliance, and support logic all in one place. This leads to extremely tight coupling, low cohesion, and difficult maintainability.",
  "solution": "Refactor into smaller, domain-specific services. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle by splitting concerns like authentication, payment, shipping, notification, and reporting into separate classes. Use interfaces and dependency injection to reduce coupling, and consider orchestration patterns (Facade, Mediator) to coordinate workflow without making one class responsible for everything."
