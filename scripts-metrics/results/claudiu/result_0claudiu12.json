 "problem": "The `MegaController` exhibits multiple serious design flaws that severely affect readability, testability, maintainability, and scalability:\n\n1. **Extremely High Lack of Cohesion (LCOM = 964)**: This indicates almost no method in the class collaborates with others or shares fields. The controller is acting as multiple unrelated classes fused into one.\n\n2. **Very High Weighted Methods per Class (WMC = 47)**: There are too many complex methods in a single class. This bloats the controller and makes it hard to understand or debug.\n\n3. **Excessive Cyclomatic (96) and Cognitive Complexity (218)**: Each method contains deeply nested branches, procedural logic, and validation code, often mixing business logic with orchestration. This indicates very poor separation of concerns and leads to fragile, hard-to-test methods.\n\n4. **Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The controller handles unrelated concerns—user registration, product search, orders, system health, analytics, etc.—in a single monolithic unit.\n\n5. **God Object Anti-pattern**: It keeps track of dozens of unrelated internal states like login attempts, product caches, metrics, alerts, and discounts in the same class, making it highly error-prone and unscalable.\n\n6. **Poor Maintainability and Testability**: Adding a new feature requires modifying this bloated class, risking regression in unrelated parts. Unit testing any method is challenging due to shared state and unstructured logic.",
  "solution": "To address the design problems, the controller should be **completely refactored and modularized**. The following improvements are critical:\n\n1. **Split the `MegaController` into Multiple Domain-Specific Controllers**:\n   - `UserController`: for registration, login, session handling\n   - `ProductController`: for search, product updates\n   - `OrderController`: for order creation, refund\n   - `AnalyticsController`: for dashboards and metrics\n   - `SystemController`: for monitoring endpoints\n\n2. **Move Business Logic into Service Classes**:\n   - Each controller should delegate logic to a corresponding `UserService`, `ProductService`, etc., separating request handling from business rules\n   - This makes the code easier to maintain, test, and extend\n\n3. **Use DTOs and Validators**:\n   - Extract validation rules into reusable validator classes or annotations\n   - Use `@Service`, `@Component`, and `@Validated` properly in the Spring ecosystem\n\n4. **Leverage Spring Features for Cleaner Logic**:\n   - Use filters or interceptors for shared concerns like rate limiting or IP tracking\n   - Use `@ExceptionHandler` or global error handlers to eliminate repetitive `try-catch`\n\n5. **Introduce Repositories and Domain Models**:\n   - Persist data like users, products, orders in proper repositories\n   - Avoid keeping important domain data in memory (e.g., `activeSessions`, `productCache`, etc.)\n\n6. **Apply SRP and Encapsulation**:\n   - Ensure each class and method has a single, clearly defined responsibility\n   - Keep controller methods short, ideally delegating to services within 3–5 lines\n\n7. **Improve Observability and Logging**:\n   - Integrate structured logging, monitoring, and tracing per module to simplify debugging\n\n8. **Write Isolated Unit Tests**:\n   - Once refactored, write tests targeting individual service classes with mocks for dependencies\n\nBy applying clean architecture principles and enforcing strong modular boundaries, this controller can be transformed into a maintainable, scalable component of a well-structured system."
