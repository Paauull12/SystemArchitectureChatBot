  "problem": "The `IntegrationOrchestrator` class suffers from **severe architectural and maintainability issues**, primarily due to its high **efferent coupling**, **cognitive complexity**, and **lack of cohesion**:\n\n1. **Extreme Efferent Coupling (Ce ≈ 25+)**: The class directly depends on a wide variety of volatile services including databases, caches, REST APIs, cloud storage, messaging systems, CRMs, and payment providers. This tight coupling results in high instability and low resilience to change.\n\n2. **Very High Cognitive Complexity (75)**: The `processCustomerOrder` method alone contains deeply nested control flow, multiple fallbacks, and chains of service calls. This makes the logic difficult to reason about, test, or modify without introducing regressions.\n\n3. **Low Cohesion (LCOM = 122)**: Methods within the class touch unrelated services and responsibilities — a clear violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). There's no separation between database access, external integration, business rules, or orchestration logic.\n\n4. **Monolithic Integration Logic**: All orchestration is handled in a single method with procedural branching, making the code brittle and hard to extend or reuse.\n\n5. **Poor Testability**: The logic depends on real services and is riddled with nested `try-catch` blocks, hindering unit testing and making mocking difficult without major refactoring.\n\n6. **Code Smells**: Includes long methods, god class, feature envy (methods that use many fields not their own), and speculative generality (unused complex methods for reporting and syncing).",
  "solution": "To drastically improve modularity, testability, and maintainability:\n\n1. **Decompose the Class into Bounded Contexts**:\n   - `CustomerRepository` (fetch and cache customer)\n   - `PaymentService` (Stripe, fallback, logging)\n   - `CRMService` (Salesforce and HubSpot updates)\n   - `NotificationService` (email, SMS, Slack)\n   - `OrderEventPublisher` (Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis)\n   - `OrderProcessorFacade` to coordinate workflows\n\n2. **Encapsulate Each External Integration with Adapter or Proxy Patterns**:\n   - Create interfaces like `ICRMClient`, `IPaymentProcessor`, `INotificationChannel`\n   - Use factories or dependency injection to instantiate real or mock versions\n\n3. **Apply the Orchestration/Coordination Pattern**:\n   - Move sequencing logic into a high-level coordinator class that calls smaller service classes\n   - This central logic should handle workflow orchestration without containing the integration logic itself\n\n4. **Break Down Large Methods**:\n   - Extract each major step (payment, CRM update, notification) into private or service-level methods\n   - Make error handling uniform using a centralized `ErrorHandler`\n\n5. **Replace Nested `try-catch` Chains with Resilience Patterns**:\n   - Use libraries like Resilience4j or Spring Retry to handle fallback, retry, circuit breakers cleanly\n\n6. **Increase Observability**:\n   - Use structured logging, tracing, and monitoring across service boundaries to track failures\n\n7. **Add Meaningful Unit Tests and Integration Tests**:\n   - After decomposition, write focused tests using mocks or stubs for each service class\n\nThis class is a textbook example of what should be separated into a microservice architecture or, at the very least, a clean layered modular design. Refactoring it will significantly enhance clarity, scalability, and development velocity."
