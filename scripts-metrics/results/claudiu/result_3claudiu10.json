"problem": "The `ExternalServiceClient` class suffers from significant **instability and high efferent coupling**. It directly depends on numerous volatile third-party APIs and SDKs (Stripe, PayPal, Twilio, SendGrid, Slack, Google Maps, Salesforce, HubSpot, Mixpanel, etc.), resulting in:\n\n1. **High Instability (Ce ≈ 20+)**: The class is highly sensitive to changes in external services. Any API change, outage, or version update in one dependency can break the entire class.\n\n2. **Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle**: It handles diverse concerns—payments, notifications, CRM syncing, analytics, and data fetching—all in one class.\n\n3. **Tight Coupling**: Hard-coded SDK usage and authentication keys make it difficult to mock services or swap out integrations during testing or migration.\n\n4. **Low Testability**: External API calls are deeply embedded within business logic, hindering isolated unit testing and increasing reliance on integration tests.\n\n5. **High LCOM (104)**: The class lacks cohesion. Each method uses its own small subset of fields, indicating unrelated responsibilities bundled together.",
  "solution": "To improve the maintainability, modularity, and testability of this class:\n\n1. **Split the class into multiple focused service classes**, each representing a domain concern:\n   - `PaymentService` (Stripe, PayPal)\n   - `NotificationService` (Twilio, SendGrid, Slack)\n   - `ExternalDataFetcher` (Weather, Currency, Maps)\n   - `CrmSyncService` (Salesforce, HubSpot)\n   - `AnalyticsService` (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)\n\n2. **Define interfaces** (e.g., `IPaymentProcessor`, `INotificationSender`) to decouple business logic from SDK implementations. This allows mocking during tests and supports future extensibility.\n\n3. **Use dependency injection** to inject SDK clients (e.g., `RestTemplate`, `AmazonS3`, `HttpClient`, etc.), reducing hard dependencies and enabling test configurations.\n\n4. **Externalize configuration** (API keys, URLs, tokens) into application properties or environment variables, not hardcoded fields.\n\n5. **Implement retry, circuit breaker, and fallback mechanisms** using Spring Retry, Resilience4j, or similar tools in a centralized manner rather than scattered try-catch blocks.\n\n6. **Apply Adapter or Facade patterns** to wrap external services, providing a stable internal interface and encapsulating volatile API logic.\n\n7. **Use centralized logging and error handling** so failures across services are managed consistently without cluttering business logic.\n\nRefactoring this class will not only improve code quality but also increase its resilience to API changes, enhance developer experience, and support scalability."
