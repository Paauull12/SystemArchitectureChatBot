  "problem": "The `DataProcessor` class exhibits several major code quality issues:\n\n1. **High Cyclomatic Complexity (102)** and **Cognitive Complexity (289)**: The methods `processCSVFile` and `processExcelFile` contain deep nesting, complex validation rules, and lengthy branching logic. This makes the class difficult to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n2. **High Lack of Cohesion (LCOM = 15)**: The class manages processing logic for unrelated data types (CSV, Excel, JSON, Database, Email), each with its own set of fields. Methods operate in isolation with no shared behavior, indicating a strong violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n3. **God Object Symptoms**: The class handles multiple independent concerns (file I/O, database access, email delivery, parsing), accumulating too much responsibility and knowledge about unrelated systems.\n\n4. **High Instability and Efferent Coupling**: Though `efferentCoupling` is marked -1 in the metrics, the class depends on many external libraries (Apache POI, OpenCSV, Jackson, Commons IO, etc.), creating a fragile dependency graph.\n\n5. **Low Reusability and Testability**: Tightly coupled logic with direct file and database access hinders mocking and unit testing, reducing modularity.",
  "solution": "To improve maintainability, scalability, and testability:\n\n1. **Refactor into separate, focused classes**, each handling a single format:\n   - `CsvProcessor`\n   - `ExcelProcessor`\n   - `JsonProcessor`\n   - `DatabaseExporter`\n   - `EmailReporter`\n\n2. **Apply the Interface Segregation Principle** by defining a common interface such as `DataProcessorInterface` with a method like `ProcessingResult process(File input, File output, Map<String, Object> options)`.\n\n3. **Extract configuration fields** (e.g., delimiter, sheet name, SMTP host) into immutable configuration classes passed to each processor at runtime.\n\n4. **Reduce complexity** in large methods by breaking them into smaller helper methods, such as:\n   - `validateFilePath(...)`\n   - `parseCsvHeaders(...)`\n   - `transformRow(...)`\n   - `writeCsvOutput(...)`\n\n5. **Use dependency injection** for components such as `ObjectMapper`, `Connection`, or email clients, to improve testability and decouple from implementation details.\n\n6. **Introduce shared error handling and logging** across all processors for consistency.\n\n7. **Create test cases** for each processor independently, using mocks or in-memory representations of input/output.\n\n8. If needed, **compose a `CompositeDataProcessor`** for orchestrating multiple processors, each conforming to a common interface, but keep implementations independent.\n\nThis modularization will make the system easier to evolve, enable parallel development, and drastically improve code readability and maintainability."
