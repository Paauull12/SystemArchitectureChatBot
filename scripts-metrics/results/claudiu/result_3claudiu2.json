  "problem": "The APIGateway class suffers from several design issues:\n1. Very high Cyclomatic Complexity (37) and Cognitive Complexity (98), especially in the handleRequest() method, which includes deeply nested conditions and multi-path logic.\n2. Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) is 62, indicating an overloaded class.\n3. Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM) is extremely high (223), showing that many methods operate on different subsets of data, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.\n4. High Efferent Coupling: the class directly depends on over 15 external components, increasing fragility and decreasing testability.\n5. The class combines multiple responsibilities: security, logging, rate limiting, routing, transformation, caching, forwarding, and monitoring, making it hard to change or extend.",
  "solution": "Refactor the APIGateway class using the following strategies:\n1. Extract each logical concern (e.g., security validation, rate limiting, request transformation, caching, forwarding, etc.) into separate service classes (e.g., SecurityService, RateLimitingService, TransformationService).\n2. Apply the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping each class focused on one job.\n3. Reduce Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity in handleRequest() by splitting it into smaller private helper methods or using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.\n4. Use Dependency Injection to manage external dependencies and make the class easier to test.\n5. Define clear interfaces for each external service and use composition rather than inheritance.\n6. Consider using a Mediator or Orchestrator pattern to coordinate the responsibilities across modular services.\n7. Write unit tests for each smaller service to ensure correct behavior in isolation."
