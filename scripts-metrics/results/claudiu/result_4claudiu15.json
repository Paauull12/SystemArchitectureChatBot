  "problem": "The `ProcessingEngine` class suffers from multiple design and complexity issues:\n\n1. **Very High Cognitive Complexity (185)**: The logic, particularly in methods like `processImageBatch` and `analyzeTextComplexity`, is deeply nested and difficult to follow. This makes the code hard to read, reason about, and maintain.\n\n2. **High Cyclomatic Complexity (50)**: Indicates a large number of independent paths through the code, leading to difficult and potentially incomplete testing scenarios.\n\n3. **High Weighted Method Count (WMC = 66)**: Suggests the class does too much and violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.\n\n4. **High Lack of Cohesion (LCOM = 78)**: Confirms that methods operate on different, non-overlapping sets of fields, meaning the class is not logically cohesive. For example, image-related, text-related, math-related, and file-related processing are implemented in a single class without shared purpose.\n\n5. **Low Tight Class Cohesion (TCC â‰ˆ 0.08)**: Only about 8% of method pairs access common fields, indicating minimal internal collaboration between methods. This undermines encapsulation and reusability.\n\n6. **Mixing Concerns**: The class mixes four unrelated domains: image processing, text analysis, math operations, and file queue handling. This makes the class harder to understand and evolve.",
  "solution": "The `ProcessingEngine` class should be refactored using **separation of concerns** and **modular design**:\n\n1. **Extract Classes by Responsibility**:\n   - `ImageProcessor`: for all image-related logic and fields.\n   - `TextAnalyzer`: for text replacements, stop word filtering, and complexity scoring.\n   - `MathCalculator`: for number-based operations and caching.\n   - `FileProcessor`: for file queue processing and size validation.\n\n2. **Isolate Configuration/Constants**: Move directory paths, supported formats, and file size limits into configuration or constant classes.\n\n3. **Simplify Nested Logic**: Refactor `processImageBatch` and `analyzeTextComplexity` to reduce nesting via guard clauses, early returns, and delegated private helper methods.\n\n4. **Testability and Maintainability**: Each new class should be tested independently. This improves test coverage and allows changes without impacting unrelated domains.\n\n5. **Consider Strategy or Command Pattern**: For handling filters (e.g., `blur`, `sharpen`), define a strategy interface `ImageFilterStrategy` and implement each filter separately.\n\nThis restructuring will drastically reduce complexity, improve maintainability, support testing, and make the codebase scalable for future enhancements."
