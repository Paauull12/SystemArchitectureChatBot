  "problem": "The `ConfigurationManager` class has major maintainability and design problems:\n1. **Extremely high WMC (227)** and **Cognitive Complexity (269)** indicate an overburdened class with many responsibilities and complex logic.\n2. **Cyclomatic Complexity (112)** is far above recommended thresholds, with individual methods (e.g., `getConfiguration`, `refreshConfiguration`) exceeding 40+, making them hard to test, debug, and modify.\n3. **LCOM (3299)** indicates very poor cohesionâ€”many methods operate independently, showing a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n4. The class has **high instability** and **tight coupling to volatile external systems** (Consul, ZooKeeper, Vault, AWS, Redis, etc.), which increases the risk of failure and difficulty in managing changes.\n5. It serves as a God Object used by over 60+ services, creating high afferent coupling (though not reflected numerically in the result, it is evident from usage). This centralization makes it a single point of failure and bottleneck for changes.\n6. Difficult to unit test, extend, or safely refactor due to the breadth of functionality and deep conditional logic.",
  "solution": "1. **Decompose the `ConfigurationManager` class** into smaller, focused components:\n   - `FileConfigLoader`, `SpringConfigLoader`, `RemoteConfigLoader`, `SecretManager`, `ConfigCacheManager`, `ConfigValidator`, etc.\n2. Introduce a **strategy pattern** for loading configuration by source type. Each source (Vault, S3, JSON, etc.) should have its own class implementing a common `ConfigSourceLoader` interface.\n3. Move post-processing concerns (e.g., decryption, conversion, validation) into a **chain-of-responsibility pipeline** for better modularity.\n4. Replace procedural conditionals with **polymorphic dispatch** using an interface for each config backend.\n5. Reduce responsibilities by separating out backup, refresh, and health-check features into distinct manager classes (e.g., `ConfigurationBackupManager`, `ConfigurationRefreshManager`).\n6. Use dependency injection and factories to manage optional dependencies cleanly and improve testability.\n7. Introduce **caching abstraction** to isolate caching logic and allow plugging in different strategies (in-memory, distributed, etc.).\n8. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for each extracted component. Use mocks for external services.\n9. Use a **configuration schema and validation framework** to declaratively define expected config structure and rules (e.g., using JSON Schema or Spring Boot's @ConfigurationProperties).\n10. Gradually migrate services to use a thin `ConfigFacade` that delegates to the refactored system, maintaining backward compatibility while simplifying future change."
