  "problem": "The `OrderProcessor` class exhibits several serious maintainability and testability issues:\n\n1. **High Cyclomatic Complexity (23)**: Indicates a large number of decision points (`if`, `else if`, `switch`, etc.), making the code hard to understand, test, and maintain. Each added branch increases the number of test cases needed for full coverage.\n\n2. **Extremely High Cognitive Complexity (255)**: Suggests deeply nested conditions and complex logic, which greatly increases the mental load required to reason about the code.\n\n3. **High Weighted Method Count (WMC = 68)**: This indicates that the class has too many responsibilities and contributes to poor cohesion.\n\n4. **Very High Lack of Cohesion (LCOM = 360)**: Confirms that methods do not share data or purpose well, and are operating on distinct concepts, which violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.\n\n5. **Multiple Exit Points and Deep Nesting**: The main method (`processOrder`) contains many early `return` statements and deeply nested `if` blocks, making the control flow difficult to follow and prone to bugs.\n\n6. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Category-specific logic (electronics, books, food, medicine) is entangled with order validation, breaking modularity and violating **Open/Closed Principle**.",
  "solution": "Refactor the `OrderProcessor` class by breaking it down into smaller, single-purpose classes and methods:\n\n1. **Apply Strategy Pattern**: For category-specific logic (`electronics`, `books`, etc.), create an interface `ItemProcessor` with an implementation for each category (`ElectronicsProcessor`, `BooksProcessor`, etc.). This keeps category logic open for extension, closed for modification.\n\n2. **Extract Validator Classes**: Move customer, order, and inventory validations into separate `Validator` classes (e.g., `CustomerValidator`, `OrderValidator`).\n\n3. **Use a Handler Chain or Command Pattern**: To streamline order item processing and reduce nested conditionals, model processing steps as a chain of handlers.\n\n4. **Flatten Nested Conditionals**: Use guard clauses and return early to simplify the main methodâ€™s logic. This reduces nesting and improves readability.\n\n5. **Split into Services**:\n   - `OrderService`: overall orchestration.\n   - `PaymentService`: checks balance and payment validity.\n   - `CategoryService`: delegates to the appropriate processor.\n\n6. **Improve Testability**: Inject dependencies and isolate category logic for unit testing each case without needing to execute the full flow.\n\nThese changes will reduce complexity, improve code reuse, enable unit testing of specific paths, and ensure the codebase can scale with additional item categories or rules."
