  "problem": "The method in PoorCollectionChoice uses an ArrayList to store users but re-creates the list on every call and relies on contains() to prevent duplicates. This approach is inefficient and semantically inappropriate. ArrayList has linear-time lookups for contains(), making it a poor choice when uniqueness is required. Additionally, since the list is re-initialized each time, no user is actually retained between calls, rendering the logic ineffective.",
  "solution": "A more suitable collection for enforcing uniqueness is a Set, such as HashSet, which offers constant-time lookups and naturally prevents duplicates. Furthermore, the collection should be defined at the class level if persistence across method calls is intended. This change not only improves performance but also ensures correctness by aligning the data structure with the intended behavior."
