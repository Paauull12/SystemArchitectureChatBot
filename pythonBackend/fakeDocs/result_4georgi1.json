  "problem": "The current Application class combines authentication, business logic, database operations, and UI responses all within a single method, resulting in a monolithic design. This tightly coupled structure makes the system difficult to scale, maintain, and test because any change to one responsibility can impact others. It violates the principles of Separation of Concerns and Single Responsibility, creating bottlenecks that hinder the systemâ€™s ability to grow or adapt efficiently.",
  "solution": "To address this, the code should be refactored into a layered architecture that separates responsibilities into distinct classes or components. Authentication, business logic, data access, and presentation should each be handled independently, improving modularity and maintainability. This approach facilitates easier testing, promotes code reuse, and supports scalability by allowing individual layers to evolve without affecting the entire system. For example, extracting authentication into an AuthService, order processing into an OrderService, and database interactions into an OrderRepository can greatly improve the overall design and future-proof the application."
