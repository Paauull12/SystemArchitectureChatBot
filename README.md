# ChatBot for Architecture

## What Problem Will Be Solved

We're addressing the challenge of ensuring that your architecture is up to date and that engineers avoid mistakes when developing an application. The ChatBot will respond based either on the context provided (such as code files shared by the user) or on files with detected issues, intelligently retrieved by our system based on metrics.

## Why AI for Architecture?

### Key Benefits:
- **Accelerated Design Process:** It's easier to design when you have an on-demand assistant trained in architectural best practices.
- **Smart Recommendations:** AI-driven suggestions based on best practices, regulations, and current project files.
- **24/7 Availability:** Instant architectural consultation at any timeâ€”especially helpful for junior developers who often need more guidance.

## Technology Stack

- **AI/ML:** OpenAI Model API  
- **Backend:** Python with Flask and LangChain  
- **Frontend:** Visual Studio Code Extension  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL â€“ to be implemented  

## Current Status

Development â€“ early stages

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1:** Basic conversational AI for architectural queries  
- **Phase 2:** Integration with metrics for every file scanned upon modification  
- **Phase 3:** Retrieval from a vector database for suggestions based on metrics  
- **Phase 4:** Implementation of smart and manual document retrieval to provide additional context to the ChatBot
